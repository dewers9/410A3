RUN make to compile files

UPDATE the Server IP address in client.c to match your vm IP Address

COPY webserver executable to vm and run that on the vm

RUN client on machine to have access to arduino via serial port

Depending on what version of python you have installed on your vm you may need to change the she-bang line in the python files to end in python3

if for some reason, the my-histogram.py program is not working, run :

    export OPENBLAS_CORETYPE=ARMV8 python3

    chmod +xwr *.cgi
    
    chmod +xwr *.py

If the time is not being reported correctly from the server, restart the VM to resync time.
